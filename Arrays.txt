𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲𝐬
An 𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲 is a collection of items stored at 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. Hence, making it a 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲. The idea is to store multiple items/elements of the 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value. 

𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 -  the memory location of the first element of the array
𝗢𝗳𝗳𝘀𝗲𝘁 - the difference between two indices.

Arrays are used to 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. They are particularly useful when you need to store a list of items, such as a list of numbers, names, or other data.

𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲𝐬:
1)	Homogeneous elements
2)	Accessing through ‘index’
3)	Fixed size

𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲:
// Declaration
int numbers[5];

// Initialization
numbers[0] = 1;
numbers[1] = 2;
numbers[2] = 3;
numbers[3] = 4;
numbers[4] = 5;

𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲:
Cout<<numbers[4];

𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲𝐬:
1)	Insertion
2)	Deletion
3)	Traversing
4)	Searching
5)	Sorting

𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬:
1)	Fast Access: Accessing an element by its index is very fast.
2)	Memory Efficiency: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which makes them memory efficient.

𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬:
1)	Fixed Size: The size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed once declared.
2)	Homogeneous Elements: Arrays can only store elements of the same type.
