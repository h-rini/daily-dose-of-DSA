Memory is the ability of a computer to store and retrieve data. Think of memory as a workspace where the computer temporarily holds data it needs to access quickly.

𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆
There are two main types of memory in a computer: Primary Memory and Secondary Memory.

1. 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 (𝐌𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲)
Primary memory is the computer’s 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆, which is directly accessible by the CPU. It is 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 but usually has a 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 compared to secondary memory. Primary memory is further divided into two types:
•	RAM (Random Access Memory): This is the memory used by the computer to store data that is currently being used or processed. RAM is 𝘃𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗲, meaning it loses its data when the computer is turned off.
  	Example: When you open a program, it gets loaded from the hard drive into RAM so that the CPU can access it quickly.
•	ROM (Read-Only Memory): This memory contains data that is 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻 and cannot be modified easily. ROM is 𝗻𝗼𝗻-𝘃𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗲, meaning it retains its data even when the computer is turned off.
    Example: The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) of a computer is stored in ROM.

2. 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 (𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞)
Secondary memory is used for 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴-𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 of data. It is 𝘀𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 than primary memory but has a much 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆. Examples include hard drives, SSDs (Solid State Drives), and external storage devices like USB drives.
•	Hard Drive: A traditional storage device that uses spinning disks to read/write data.
•	SSD: A faster storage device that uses flash memory to store data.

Memory works by storing data in binary form (0s and 1s). Each memory cell can hold a bit of data, and multiple cells are grouped together to form bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, etc.
Memory Hierarchy
Memory is organized in a hierarchy based on speed and cost:
1.	𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 : Small, fast storage locations within the CPU.
2.	𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆: A small amount of high-speed memory located close to the CPU to speed up access to frequently used data.
3.	𝗥𝗔𝗠: Main memory used for running applications.
4.	𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲: Used for long-term data storage.

𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
•	𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: Retrieving data from memory.
•	𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Storing data into memory.
•	𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲: The time it takes to read/write data from/to memory.

1.	𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺 : When you open the word processor, the program is loaded from the hard drive into RAM.
2.	𝗘𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 : As you type, the changes are temporarily stored in RAM.
3.	𝗦𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 : When you save your work, the data is written from RAM to the hard drive for long-term storage.

In the case of Applications, the applications are stored on the storage but are launched on the memory. Hence, when too many applications are run on a system, it tends to slow down a little bit. (running out of memory space).
Each element is represented in a 32-bit binary format.
A byte is a small unit of data. Each byte is equal to 8 bits.
This applies for all the data-types.
